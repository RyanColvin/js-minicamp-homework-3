# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects - It's like a variable with many values, it has properties that describes what the object is (car.weight     = 2000 pounds), then it has methods that describes what the object does(car.brake()).
	* Properties - They are what makes an object, each property(firstName) has a value('BOB')
	* Methods - These are actions of an object represented as functions(function() {retrun this.firstName + "" +           this.lastName;})
	* for in loop - They loop the the properties of an object, inside the for/in loop is executed once for each            property. Here is the syntax - for (var in object) {
        code block to be executed}
	* dot notation vs bracket notation - Always use dot notation except when you can't and need to use bracket         notation
